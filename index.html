			<span class="timestamp">2010-10-22</span>
			<p>The 391,832 reports (&#8217;The Iraq War Logs&#8217;), document the war and occupation in Iraq, from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2009 (except for the months of May 2004 and March 2009) as told by soldiers in the United States Army. Each is a &#8217;SIGACT&#8217; or Significant Action in the war. They detail events as seen and heard by the US military troops on the ground in Iraq and are the first real glimpse into the secret history of the war that the United States government has been privy to throughout.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.collateralmurder.com/">Video: Collateral Murder</a></h2>
			<span class="timestamp">2010-04-05</span>
			<p>WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad &mdash; including two Reuters news staff. Reuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-sight, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.</p>
